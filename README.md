# Port Scanner
It is implemented in Python is a tool that allows you to scan a target host or network for open ports. It is a valuable utility for network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers to assess the security of a system or network. Below, I'll provide an overview of this project, the technologies used, and how it works:

# Project Overview:
The Port Scanner project involves creating a Python program that can probe a range of network ports on a target system, determining which ports are open and which are closed. The open ports indicate services or applications that are actively listening on the target system. This project can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities or security issues.

# Technologies Used:

Python: Python is the primary programming language used for this project. It's a versatile language with a rich ecosystem of libraries that make it suitable for networking tasks.

Socket Programming: Python's socket library is crucial for creating network connections and sending packets. It allows you to connect to a specific IP address and port to check whether it's open.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): The project may implement a command-line interface to specify the target host or IP range, specify the range of ports to scan, and other scanning options.

# How the Project Works:

User Input: The project typically starts by asking the user for input. This might include the target host or IP address and the range of ports to scan. For example, the user might specify an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and a range of ports (e.g., 1-1024).

Port Scanning Logic: The Python program uses socket programming to attempt to connect to each port within the specified range. It can use various scanning techniques, such as full connect scans, SYN scans, or UDP scans, depending on the project's goals.

Port Status Detection: When a connection attempt is made to a specific port, the program checks whether the connection was successful. If successful, the port is marked as "open"; otherwise, it's marked as "closed."

Output: The project typically provides feedback to the user by printing the results to the console. It lists the open ports, potentially with additional information about the services running on those ports.
